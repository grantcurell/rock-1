# queue types are 'memory' and 'persisted'
# persisted writes the logs to disk before processing them.
# This can help prevent Logstash from getting overwhelmed
# during temporary spikes in event rates
# queue.max_bytes is the size of the queue and is only used with persisted

# x-pack features are optional and require a license
# monitoring is included in the free license.
# monitoring allows you to monitor the performance of logstash
# Things monitored: event rates, event latency, JVM Heap, System Load.
