Querying

Query Language
A user requests packets from stenographer by specifying them with a very simple query language. This language is a simple subset of BPF, and includes the primitives:

host 8.8.8.8          # Single IP address (hostnames not allowed)
net 1.0.0.0/8         # Network with CIDR
net 1.0.0.0 mask 255.255.255.0  # Network with mask
port 80               # Port number (UDP or TCP)
ip proto 6            # IP protocol number 6
icmp                  # equivalent to 'ip proto 1'
tcp                   # equivalent to 'ip proto 6'
udp                   # equivalent to 'ip proto 17'

# Stenographer-specific time additions:
before 2012-11-03T11:05:00Z      # Packets before a specific time (UTC)
after 2012-11-03T11:05:00-07:00  # Packets after a specific time (with TZ)
before 45m ago        # Packets before a relative time
before 3h ago         # Packets after a relative time
NOTE: Relative times must be measured in integer values of hours or minutes as demonstrated above.

Primitives can be combined with and/&& and with or/||, which have equal precendence and evaluate left-to-right. Parens can also be used to group.

(udp and port 514) or (tcp and port 8080)

Stenoread CLI

The stenoread command line script automates pulling packets from Stenographer and presenting them in a usable format to analysts. It requests raw packets from stenographer, then runs them through tcpdump to provide a more full-featured formatting/filtering experience. The first argument to stenoread is a stenographer query (see 'Query Language' above). All other arguments are passed to tcpdump. For example:

# Request all packets from IP 1.2.3.4 port 6543, then do extra filtering by
# TCP flag, which typical stenographer does not support.
$ stenoread 'host 1.2.3.4 and port 6543' 'tcp[tcpflags] & tcp-push != 0'

# Request packets on port 8765, disabling IP resolution (-n) and showing
# link-level headers (-e) when printing them out.
$ stenoread 'port 8765' -n -e

# Request packets for any IPs in the range 1.1.1.0-1.1.1.255, writing them
# out to a local PCAP file so they can be opened in Wireshark.
$ stenoread 'net 1.1.1.0/24' -w /tmp/output_for_wireshark.pcap
